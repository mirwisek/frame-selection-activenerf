## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a collaborative notebook project aimed at reconstructing 3D scenes using LEGO Truck images. The project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, frame selection algorithms, NeRF model training, and evaluation.

## Methodology and Approach

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

Acquired a dataset comprising 106 images showcasing Lego Truck objects. These images underwent preprocessing using a Convolutional Neural Network architecture, specifically ResNet18, to generate high-dimensional image embeddings. These embeddings encapsulate visual features, aiding subsequent analyses.

### Choosing Optimal Dimensions

Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compress high-dimensional data into a more manageable space while retaining 95% of the original variance. Reduced the image embeddings to 58 dimensions, enhancing computational efficiency without significant loss of visual information.

### Data Splitting

Partitioned the dataset into distinct subsets:
- Training: 10 images strategically selected using various frame selection algorithms.
- Holdout: 90 images for subsequent analysis.
- Testing: A small subset of 6 images reserved for final testing.

### Frame Selection Algorithms

Utilized three frame selection algorithms:
1. **Random Sampling:** Randomly chosen frames without specific criteria.
2. **Furthest View Sampling:** Selection of frames capturing diverse viewpoints to maximize representation.
3. **Hierarchical Density-Based Clustering (HDBSCAN):** Identified representative frames using reduced-dimension embeddings generated by PCA.

### NeRF Training and Testing

Utilized frames selected by each algorithm to train NeRF models, facilitating the generation of 3D scenes based on learned representations. Evaluated NeRF models' performance on the testing dataset comprising 6 images to assess their capability in reconstructing realistic 3D scenes.

### Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation involved both quantitative and qualitative assessments:
- **Quantitative Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy and error rates quantified the NeRF model's performance.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Visual inspections and subjective analysis assessed the quality, realism, and fidelity of the generated 3D scenes, providing insights beyond numerical metrics.
